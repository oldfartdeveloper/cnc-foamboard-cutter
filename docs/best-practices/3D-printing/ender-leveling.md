# Ender Levelikng

IN PROCESS

## Introduction

Learning to level my new Ender 3 Pro printer during a class on learning the Ender 3 Pro was incredably frustrating, probably due to my poor hearing which makes verbal instructions hard to follow.

That night, I spent hours working through all the leveling steps on my own, mostly getting stuck.  Eventually, I figured it out and became more proficient; along the way I determined that the process I'm about to describe will work the best for me.

## Purpose

The purpose of levelling is to make the table position exactly what the remaining part of the printer needs, to be perfectly perpendicular with respect to the printer at the right height.

## What I Initially Found Difficult

My main problem is that I basically didn't know how the adjustment wheels worked.  I knew that they caused the bed to tilt, but I failed to realize that they also can raise or lower the bed as well.  As a result, I found myself "trapped" by the nozzle home position being below the bed surface.

It took me a while to figure out that the wheels needed to lower the bed down below the nozzle.  After I accomplished that, then I finally adjusted 4 positions on the bed to have the same resistance to dragging a piece of paper between the nozzle and the bed.

My biggest confusion was I continually forgot which way the wheel worked: whether turning the wheel clockwise or counterclockwise raised or lowered the bed at that point.

## The Need for Jargon

I finally decided to invent a jargon to help me remember which way each wheel worked.  Moreover, I needed different jargon for the following task sequence:

1.  First, make sure that the table was underneath the nozzle in the nozzle's home position.
1.  Secondly, level the table now that I had room to raise the bed to pinch the paper under the nozzle.

Hence, I used the following to lower and raise the bed:

* Turning wheel<br>***L***eft<br>***L***owers the bed.<p>
* Turning wheel<br>***R***ight<br>***R***aises the bed.

I used the above to make sure the bed was lower than the nozzle at all 4 corners.

Once that was accomplished, now I switched to a different metaphor; how hard the paper is being held between the bed and the nozzle.  To adjust this:

* Turning wheel<br>***L***eft<br>***L***oosens the paper.
* Turning wheel<br>r***ight***<br>t***ight***ens the paper.

I cannot tell you how much this helped me.

In reading many articles on preferred paper tension, most readers seemed to think that a the paper should be gripped only slightly, that it only should take a little effort to slide the paper through the "grip".  I experimented a bit, and found that I agreed; I liked that identifying the paper could easily (not freely) be pulled away or even pushed through.  This may be because I'm using a thinner paper used for copying (note to self: go and actually measure the thickness of the paper).

To test the levelling, I printed the calibration cube.  It looked good.
