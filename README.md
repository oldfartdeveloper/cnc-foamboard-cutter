# cnc-foamboard-cutter

(IN PROCESS -- VERY EARLY)

This project is to create a homebrew CNC foamboard cutter as described here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3951161.

At this point, I'm simply storing files needed by the project; I don't expect to be doing much coding at this time.

Specifically, am storing the 3D printer files so that I can transfer them to my 3D printer.
